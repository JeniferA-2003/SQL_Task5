SQL Joins Practice
Created two tables: Customers and Orders, and performed various join operations including:
INNER JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
Note: MySQL does not directly support FULL JOIN (also known as FULL OUTER JOIN). To achieve this, I used a combination of LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and UNION to simulate the same result.
